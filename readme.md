# InputAware  

This is my implementation of "InputAware Dynamic Backdoor Attack". However, 
the attack successful rate and benign data accuracy is much lower than the [authors'](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/input-aware-backdoor-attack-release).


Compared to the author code, mine lacks of many tricks and details(such as threshold function in mask generator). 



| Attack Successful Rate | Benign Data Accuracy | Cross-trigger Accuracy |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| 0.56 | 0.83 | 0.54 |
