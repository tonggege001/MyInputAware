# InputAware  

This is my implementation of "InputAware Dynamic Backdoor Attack". However, 
the attack successful rate and benign data accuracy is much lower than the authors'.


Compared to the author code, mine lacks of many tricks and details(such as threshold function in mask generator). 



| Attack Successful Rate | Benign Data Accuracy | Cross-trigger Accuracy |
|:----:|:----:|:----|
| 0.56 | 0.83 | 0.54 |
